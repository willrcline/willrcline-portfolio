                <h3>There are those who need to be told what to do and there are those who figure it out with grit.</h3>
                <p>With a skillset in data science and software engineering, I can use a combination of traditional automation techniques and modern AI approaches to automate any process you throw at me.<br><br> If your project needs a front end, I am also trained traditionally in web development. I am familiar with a variety of frameworks and open to adapting to your choice in technology if you have already started something. I am extensively familiar with several JS and python frameworks. <br><br> I am experienced in project management and am open to that sort of work. <br><br>I am at large in the Austin (Texas) area and am open to meeting online or in person to chat about your project. I'd love to see how I can help you technically or provide you with relevant connections from my network.</p>
