# Portfolio page for displaying previous work to employers who want to see my capablities before venturing to hire me

## [Deployment Link](https://willrcline.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Hero section 
Image background and h3 inside

## Body
The whole body uses flexbox layout.
The 3 content sections are justified in center and flex-wrapped
Each content section is also display flex and is wide enough for the .name-section and the .content-section to fit horizontally with some margin, padding, and border in between.
The images in the work section of the body uses a hover pseudoclass effect to add opacity, fixed aspect ratio with object-fit: cover and object-position: top, and have a border.
The contact me section uses flex just like the rest of them. It gets rid of the list style type and puts the list items inline and gives padding between.


## Future work:
the portfolio image section could be touched up to be more precise with aspect ratios of images(get a standardized size for ones I use)
